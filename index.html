			Good afternoon. I am 33 goals and I am from Belarus. I have been doing woodworking for almost 15 years and have progressed in this from the position of an auxiliary worker to a furniture designer. But now I would like to try myself in a new field. I hope that The Rolling Scopes will give me the opportunity to get acquainted with the world of programming, and I will be able to test myself and decide whether the profession of a developer suits me. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have anything to give as a code example yet. And the level of English is at the level of elementary school. ((
